            Hi! ðŸ˜Š I am a full stack web developer with user centered thinking,
            but it wasnâ€™t always like that...
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg font-medium text-center">
            I am an architect as well and I worked in an architectural studio
            designing, planning and directing construction projects.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg font-medium text-center">
            As part of an IT family I have always been surrounded by developers,
            I started getting curious and amaze by this new world and today I
            can say that it has become my growing passion.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-lg font-medium text-center">
            Recently I relocated to Turin, Italy and it was the perfect
            opportunity for me to explore this tech side and thatâ€™s why I
            started to study software development. Iâ€™m really excited about the
            possibility of mixing my previous and newly acquired skills.
